- Define classes representing:
    - **tires** (as a bundle needed by a car to operate); methods available: *get_pressure()*, *pump()*; attribute available: *size*
    - **engine**; methods available: *start()*, *stop()*, *get_state()*; attribute available: *fuel type*
    - **vehicle**; method available: *__init__(VIN, engine, tires)*; attribute available: *VIN*
---
- Based on the classes defined above, create the following objects:
    - two sets of **tires**: city tires (size: 15), off-road tires (size: 18)
    - two **engines**: electric engine, petrol engine
---
- Instantiate two objects representing cars:
    - the first one is a city car, built of an **electric engine** and **city tires**
    - the second one is an all-terrain car build of a **petrol engine** and **off-road tires**
