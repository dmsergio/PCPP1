"""
1. Your task is to write a code that will prepare a proposal of reduced prices
   for the candies whose total weight exceeds 300 units of weight (we donâ€™t
   care whether those are kilograms or pounds).

2. Your input is a list of dictionaries; each dictionary represents one type of
   candy. Each type of candy contains a key entitled "weight", which should
   lead you to the total weight details of the given delicacy. The input is
   presented in the editor;

3. Prepare a copy of the source list (this should be done with a one-liner)
   and then iterate over it to reduce the price of each delicacy by 20% if its
   weight exceeds the value of 300;

4. Present an original list of candies and a list that contains the proposals;

5. Check if your code works correctly when copying and modifying the candy item
   details.
